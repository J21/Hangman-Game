Welcome! First off, you ever heard of hangman? If not, I'll explain, otherwise skip to the steps below that explain how this game works. Hangman is a game where the guesser (in this case you) must try and find all the letters in a random word chosen by the computer. Normally any wrong guesses would add something to a diagram of a hanging man, but for this, we will use a random amount of guesses, similar to the psychic game in my github page. If you can guess the correct letters and/or the whole word, you win! Otherwise, if you use up the guesses, you lose. So with that, let me explain how the game works.

Step 1: A random word will be chosen from the computer. The theme is colors! But you'll know once you run the webpage.

Step 2: You try to guess a letter.

Step 3: If you guess wrong, you use up a guess, and must try again. Don't worry, the letters you have tried will be displayed below! If you guess correctly, though, one or more of the blanks will be filled with the letter. 

Step 4a: If you can figure out all the letters, you win!

Step 4b: If you use up all the guesses, you lose!

And that's all! Please enjoy the game!
